# Andrew's Homepage

This project contains my hand-written HTML homepage for the world-wide-web.

It's meant to be deployed as a simple set of files on a server, and doesn't
use anything fancy beyond what can be done with a normal text editor and an
HTTP file server.

To develop it locally, it can help to run a local server, so for that, I've
included `local-server.d`, a D script you can run to boot up a server on
`http://localhost:8080`.
